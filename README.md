# CareSync

A basic health information system built with **Next.js**, **tRPC**, **Supabase**, and **shadcn/ui**.  
CareSync allows doctors to **manage health programs** and **client enrollments**, with **API-first** access to client profiles.

---

## Features

- Create and manage **health programs** (e.g., HIV, TB, Malaria)
- Register and manage **clients**
- Enroll clients into **multiple health programs**
- **Search** and **view** client profiles
- Expose **public API** access to client profiles
- **Responsive UI** 

---

## Tech stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Shadcn (for components), Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- **Backend**: API integrated using tRPC
- **Database**: Prisma with PostgreSQL on Supabase
- **Image Handling**: UploadThing (S3-style uploads)
- **Form Handling**: React hook Forms + Zod validation
- **State Management & Caching**: React Query

---

## API-First design

- Modular API endpoints with tRPC 
- Data validation with Zod at both client and server 

---

## Security considerations

- Supabase **Row-Level Security (RLS)** policies enforced 
- Strict input validation using Zod
- HTTPS enforced assumption for all external access
- Minimal exposure of sensitive data in public APIs

---

## Innovations & Optimizations

- **Optimistic UI updates** with React Query for snappy experience
- **Serverless database** architecture using Supabase
- **Type safety end-to-end** using Prisma, tRPC, and Zod
- **Cloud-ready**: deployed to Vercel platform

---

## Deployment

- Deployment-ready for platforms like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **Supabase Edge Functions**

## Known issues

- None currently.
- Open for iterative improvements post-evaluation.

---

## Future plans

- **Add authentication**: Add role-based access (Admin, Doctor, Nurse).
- **Activity logs**: Track changes like enrollments, program updates, etc. 
- **Notifications**: Email or in-app notifications for client updates.
- **Testing**: Add integration and unit tests (Jest + Testing Library). 
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Improve mobile view UX even further. 
- **Archiving**: Ability to archive inactive clients without permanent deletion.

# Bonus ideas I have in mind (post-submission)

- **CI/CD pipelines** with GitHub Actions
- **Dockerization** for easy setup across teams

## Note

I followed an **API-first approach** by designing the backend logic first and treating the frontend as just a consumer of the API.  
Even though I used **tRPC** (not traditional REST), the principle still applies â€” server routes are defined clearly, type-safe, and consumed directly by the client without manual fetches.  
This keeps the system modular, clean, and scalable.

### Public API Exposure

Yes, I exposed **client profile data** through a public API endpoint using tRPC.  
This means external systems can access specific client information safely.  
I kept the structure flexible so that adding auth, permissions, or rate limits in the future will be straightforward.
